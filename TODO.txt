GENERAL:
	- If the port is under 1024, it is a privileged port.
		Add 8000 to the port number to get the exposed port.
	- rm les volumes si problems

	MAKEFILE:
	- creer dossier /home/<login>/transcendence/postgresql

NGINX :
	- Few problems because not all the contener are up.
		Must see later :
			- If the upstream is well defined. (30 & 37)
			- Why I cannot access mime.types. (43)
			- It proxy_pass is well defined. (83 & 92)
